## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** ⚛️
- **Framer Motion** 🎞️ (for smooth animations and transitions)
- **Styled Components** 💅 (for styling the components)
- **JavaScript** 🟨

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
├── src
│   ├── assets # Static assets like images and fonts

│   ├── pages # Pages like Home, About, Projects
│   ├── App.js # Main app entry

└── package.json # Project dependencies and scripts
```
